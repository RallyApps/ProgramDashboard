Rally Program Dashboard
======================

![Title](https://raw.github.com/RallyApps/ProgramDashboard/master/screenshots/title-screenshot.png)

## Overview

The Program Dashboard app provides an executive report of the following:

* Status of scheduled work, test cases and defects for a collection of component releases
* Visual indicator of the collection's health
* A burndown chart to see if the team is on track

## How to Use

### Running the App

If you want to start using the app immediately, create an Custom HTML app on your Rally dashboard. Then copy App.html from the deploy folder into the HTML text area. That's it, it should be ready to use. See [this](http://www.rallydev.com/help/use_apps#create) help link if you don't know how to create a dashboard page for Custom HTML apps.

Or you can just click [here](https://raw.github.com/RallyApps/ProgramDashboard/master/deploy/App.html) to find the file and copy it into the custom HTML app.

### Using the App

<b>NOTE:</b> The term Program in this app refers to a collection of related component releases, which can be re-used in multiple application releases. This help page is intended for users who have access to a deprecated Rally feature that assists in managing reusable component releases included in application releases.

If you would like to manage a program — a collection of projects sharing a common business goal and release cadence — we recommend using [Rally Portfolio Manager](http://www.rallydev.com/help/getting-started-rally-portfolio-manager).

## Customize this App

You're free to customize this app to your liking (see the License section for details). Since this app uses a very old version of Rally's SDK, the app is only presented in its deployed form.

## License
